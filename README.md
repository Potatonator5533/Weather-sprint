//This is a Weather forecast page that does not fully work yet. I did my best to replecate Jeriah's figma. I was able to get some information to show up on the main page about sacramento and that's just about it. I plan to completely finish this project over the break.

//Peer review: The figma looks similar to the weather sprint website including five day forecast, search bar, city, high and low temp, favorites, favorites icon, the weather icon, and the description of the weather icon. However, when you search a city, it does not populate the cities weather information. The information glitches and goes to the city of Manteca. The favorites is not functioning, but when you click on favorites icon, it takes you to another page where there are placeholders of five cities with the current weather information. The design of the weather website does however look great. Good job!
